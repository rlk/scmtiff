INVARIANT: SCM TIFF files are BigTIFFs.

INVARIANT: SCM TIFF files represent a complete, correct, usable spherical cube map file, regardless of data process progress.

INVARIANT: An SCM TIFF file covers the entire sphere without gaps. As a consequence of this, an SCM TIFF contains at least six pages and each page has either zero or four sub-pages.

INVARIANT: All channels have the same depth and format.

INVARIANT: All pages have the same size, channel count, min value, and max value.

NOT invariant: No page order is defined.

Mix LROC GLD100 with LOLA?


TODO
	Eliminate the 4 channel limit.
	Add min and max fields.
	Horizontal difference.
	Remove the SubIFD mechanism.  This will require changes to panoview.



samples per pixel c
sample format     f f f f
bits per sample   b b b b
min sample value  a a a a
max sample value  z z z z

An IFD can be written given
	page index x
	SCM (n, c, b, s)
	data buffer size d
	next


ifd write (s,  x,  d,  n)
ifd read  (s, &x, &d, &n)
