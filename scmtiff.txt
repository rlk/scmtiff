INVARIANT: SCM TIFF files are BigTIFFs.

INVARIANT: SCM TIFF files represent a complete, correct, usable spherical cube map file, regardless of data process progress.

INVARIANT: An SCM TIFF file covers the entire sphere without gaps. As a consequence of this, an SCM TIFF contains at least six pages and each page has either zero or four sub-pages.

INVARIANT: All channels have the same depth and format.

INVARIANT: All pages have the same size, channel count, min value, and max value.

NOT invariant: No page order is defined.


TODO:

-	Skip the decode-encode in the append phase of the mipmap tool.
		(Cache the compression by noting the state of the zip buffer.)
		If done properly, this can also optimize the combine tool's operation
		upon pages with only one contributor.

-	Update scmview with the new colormap

	Normal tool

-	Normalize option.
		Knock down the depth after sampling but before encoding.

-	Remove the min/max
		It's superfluous in the context of normalized data.

	Potential optimizations:
-		Precompute all pixel corners in convert sample
			This is a false optimization when n is not small

	Generalize channel counts in image access.
		switch (c) no longer suffices
