SCM TIFF

scmtiff is a multi-tool for generating and processing SCM TIFF image files.

scmtiff -convert ... Convert a PDS, PNG, TIFF, or JPG file to a leafy SCM TIFF.
scmtiff -combine ... Combine multiple SCM TIFF files into one.
scmtiff -mipmap  ... Sample parent pages for an SCM TIFF wherever possible.
scmtiff -border  ... Fill the borders of an SCM TIFF wherever possible.
scmtiff -normal  ... Generate a normal SCM TIFF from a height SCM TIFF.


Invariant: SCM TIFF page indices are always given in increasing order. That is, an SCM TIFF always presents a subset of a breadth-first traversal.
